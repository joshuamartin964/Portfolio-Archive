        <p class="blog-content">
          I would like to think of this blog as a narration of such, as to how I start
          my journey into becoming a front-end developer. As a way to present yourself
          to potential employers that is more outside the box than handing in CV’s to
          every agency you apply for, I decided to created my first portfolio website
          so I can showcase myself, my talents, and my thoughts and opinions on topics
          that relate to the digital field. With that being said, I’d like to use this
          blog to talk about how I went about making this portfolio site.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
          To start off the process of making the website I decided to take to the internet
          to look for some inspiration from other developer’s portfolio websites so that I
          could see what features were popular and to find some common themes. By looking
          at some professional developer’s portfolio I was hoping to find some design features
          I could implement into my own portfolio site. During my research, I decided to look
          at some blogs and articles on what makes a good portfolio.
          <br />
          <br />
          One blog that I found gave a top 10 list on what to add to your site to help you
          make a good impression for clients and employers. In the blog, author Jonathan
          Brealey gives some great tips on how to build a “killer” portfolio. One point Brealey
          makes is that you should make yourself available. Brealey mentions that you need to
          make it clear how people can get in touch with you as well as trying to add different
          methods of contact (Brealey, 2017). After looking at this point I decided to have my
          ‘Contact Me’ section available on all of my pages, as well as having links to a couple
          of my social medias.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
          In another blog I found, the author talks about how creating blogs and adding them to
          your site is a great way to show off your expertise within the industry (Kruse, 2017).
          As someone who is going into the ‘industry’ one day, I believe that providing your thoughts
          on industry standards and new techniques/technologies are an important part of committing
          yourself to your job, as well as showing your passion for it too.
          <br />

          Originally, when I had my first design drawn up I was going to do a single page design.
          My reasoning for this design concept was to draw my visitors in. By using a single page
          concept, the user would just have to scroll down the page and see all that I have to offer,
          without having to click though links to take you to external sites. However, as I started
          to develop the single page layout, I started to realise that my skills using such things as
          flex-box and grid were not as good as I thought they were. After having this realisation,
          I decided to use external links for my: blog page; CV page; portfolio page.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
          One of the few features I added to my site that I found inspiration from was from a tweet
          by @LiamFrogspark (Nelson, 2018) which mentioned a cool feature you can do with border-radius.
          I used this technique on my profile picture for the sites header to give a unique border to my picture.
          <br />
          <br />
          To continue on from what I just said regarding my skills with flex-box and grid, I manage
          to use some grid through the help of an online course. Over the summer of 2018 I was working
          as an IT administrator. During work when my schedule was free I would watch video tutorials
          from an online course ran by Wes Bos. During these videos, Bos would run through different
          things that you could do with grid. Whilst building my site I watched some videos on how to
          use grid to make my header responsive. Using these videos as a guide really helped to design
          the main point of my site.
          <br />
          <br />
          Making this website really tested my knowledge on design seeing as this is the first time
          that I decided to use flex-box and grid, as well as trying to design a single page layout.
