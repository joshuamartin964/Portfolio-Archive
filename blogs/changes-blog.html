        <h1 class="blog-title">Changes to Original Portfolio</h1>
        <p class="blog-content">
          After the hand-in of my portfolio, I had a chance to gather some feedback on how to
          improve the functionality, usability, and design of my portfolio.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3 class="sub-titles">Header:</h3>
        <p class="blog-content">
          The headers layout on the original version of the site housed: my name; a profile picture of
          myself; and some extra text informing the reader that I am a front-end developer, and asking
          if the reader wanted to find out more. One piece of feedback I received informed me that the
          vertical, centred layout did not make good use of white space as well as too spread out amongst
          the content.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-content">
          To change this, I decided it was best to split the header in two, by putting the Title and
          text on the left hand side of the page, as well as bringing the navigation up to the right
          hand side. Rather than the navigation being below and spanning the full width of the viewers
          screen. The navigation also wraps underneath when on mobile devices.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h3 class="sub-titles">Typography:</h3>
        <p class="blog-content">
          The typography, including the: font; size; colour, was also critiqued. In the original design,
          the choice of font for headers (enter font) and body (enter font) did not complement each other
          well and were changed to Roboto for the header and Monserrat. I chose these two fonts for my site
          because I already was a fan of the Roboto font, having used the font previously, and when searching
          for a body font on Google Fonts, it was brought to my attention that Monserrat pairs well in the header
          body combo.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
          When choosing the colour pallet for the first version of this site, a lot of bizarre, and not very
          complimentary, colours were chosen. And one of those choices ended up being a green colour for the
          body text. This green choice was originally picked as a dummy colour and was going to be altered
          before the submission. However, by my own fault, the body text colour remained green.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-content">
          The size of the text was mentioned during my feedback, specifically having certain parts of the
          text in capitals. Having being told that capital text comes across aggressively, I promptly altered
          the text and adjusted it accordingly.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h3 class="sub-titles">Layout:</h3>
        <p class="blog-content">
          When adding the changes from the feedback I received about my portfolio site I decided to change
          the majority of the layout and colour scheme, whilst keeping the simplistic design I originally used.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-content">
          The comments I received on the layout mainly focused on the home page, CV page, and the blog pages.
          The middle section on the homepage was an “About Me” section. The width of the text and the margin
          placement did not fit the design of the rest of the site. Thus, changes were made to keep consistency
          throughout the site.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-content">
          The blog and CV page shared the same layout. The original design held content in a controlled layout
          however, the lack of design was mentioned. By adding a left and bottom border, some images, and original
          designs for quotes, I was able to improve the overall layout of these pages.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h3 class="sub-titles">Coding On Different Devices:</h3>
        <p class="blog-content">
          As I was coding my website portfolio, I used a mobile first approach by using the aid of Google
          Chrome developer tools to view the site on a responsive view port. Towards the end of the
          development, I needed to relocate from where I had been working as well as moving over to a
          laptop view port. When this change occurred, so did problems.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-content">
          Upon load of my site on a browser all the proportions of the site had been altered and
          the site was no longer responsive.
