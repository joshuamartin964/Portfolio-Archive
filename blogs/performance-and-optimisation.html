        <p class="blog-content">
          Every developer, not matter the level of experience, will sometimes overlook
          some of the import steps of creating a website. Important steps some developers
          might miss out (including myself from time to time) involve the performance and
          optimisation of: code; performance/optimisation of the sites loading time (how
          long each page/piece of media takes to load on a user’s browser); SEO integration.
          During this blog post, I will run over some steps you can take to make your website
          the best it can be.
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-titles">Code:</h3>
        <p class="blog-content">
          <span class="quote">
            “Performance optimization is one of the biggest threats to your code” (Bloch, 2018)
          </span>
          When it comes to writing your code for your website, code validation is a very
          important part of optimising your website. A simple way to help towards optimising
          your code is to make sure it reads correctly. By indenting your code, using correct
          and relevant class/id tags, and commenting your code when necessary will already make
          your code easier to read for yourself, anyone who looks at your code, and anyone who
          happens to work on your code after you. Having easy to read code really has an impact
          on the optimisation of your site.
          <br />
          <br />
          Another very crucial step you should always take is validating your code through W3C
          Validator. This website allows you to upload pages of your site, one page at a time,
          and the W3C will go through your code, line-by-line, and tell you if you have passed
          the validation test or not. If you have not passed this test, W3C will highlight lines
          in your code that either need changing or are just a warning. By running your code
          through W3C Validator you are ensuring that your code will be on its way to having the
          best performance it can.
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-titles">Optimisation:</h3>
        <p class="blog-content">
          When it comes to optimising your site, it can mean a couple of things. Two of the main
          meaning is behind optimised media and the load time of the site. When it comes to optimising
          media, in my opinion I believe it is one of the most important things. A blog titled “What
          is image optimization and why is it important for a website?” questions that if we were to
          find a way to reduce the size of an images file size without affecting the images quality,
          then we would have a positive impact on the users-experience on our sites (Sharma, 2018).
          By reducing the size of an image originally in PhotoShop and then further that by using a
          site such as tinypng.com, then the performance of the site will increase positively.
          <br />
          <br />
          Other methods you can use is running your website through web performance checker. Using sites
          such as google PageSpeed can help you check the speed and loading times of your pages. This will
          help you to check if your site loads within a decent time (under 3 seconds) on different browsers
          with different connection strengths.
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-titles">SEO Integration:</h3>
        <p class="blog-content">
          SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) can be whittled down to quality of code. Making sure that
          you have well written, semantic code is the best way to have good SEO. Using the likes of
          SEO analysers can help you run through your code and make sure it is SEO ready. Focusing on
          using correct and relevant: alt text; social media links; good meta data descriptions all
          help to aiding your SEO integration.
