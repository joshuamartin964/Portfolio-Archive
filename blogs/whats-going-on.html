              As a current 3rd year student studying Web Development Manchester Metropolitan
              University I will soon be looking into joining the “industry” and I would like
              to discuss the position in which digital industry is currently in. When I was in
              my last year of college (mainly due to tutors, UCAS, and parents), I started to
              think about what I wanted to do with my life.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-content">
              During my time at college, I was lucky enough to get some work experience at company
              called Harvey Walsh Ltd who provide online tools for the NHS to showcase data solutions.
              As the company made bespoke web applications for the NHS, I was able to work alongside
              two members of the development team in which I would shadow and learn different techniques
              and skills as well as the main fundamentals of HTML and CSS.  I slowly started to like
              the idea of making any website I wanted and making them from scratch, rather than using
              services such as WIX.com or GODADDY.com.
              <br />
              <br />
              After messing around with Notepad++ and using
              tutorials from the likes of Khan Academy and w3schools, I decided that being a front-end
              developer is something I would like to do for a career. So, I started to look at the
              ins-and-outs of the development industry. Over the course of my degree, I have taken
              the time to look at some reports and blogs, which discuss how the digital industry is
              doing so I thought that I should add some of my thoughts on the digital world.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-content">
              One of the main problems I have seen when looking for potential jobs is that companies/agencies
              don’t hire as many junior developers as they should. When I’ve looked on job sites like
              indeed, or even companies careers pages, the level of qualification/experience that the
              job role requires is mostly senior level, or sometimes as an example 2 years+ of industry
              experience (working in the industry, rather than just 2 years+ of experience in that field).
              <br />
              <br />
              A blog post from Melissa McEwen (McEwen, 2018) talks about how graduate/junior developers are
              finding it hard to land their first job. McEwen comments on the fact that “people who advertise
              these positions say they are inundated with resumes. But on the senior level companies complain
              they can’t find good developers”. As someone is aspiring to become a junior developer, to me it
              seems like some companies don’t like the idea of training and mentoring junior developers.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-content">
              During one of my seminars recently, my professor brought in some guests to come talk to us
              and answer any questions we had about working in the industry, as well as handing out much
              appreciated advice. Once of the guests that came in was Ian Cox, the creative director from
              Supremo. At the end of the seminar, I managed to talk to Ian and asked him his views on hiring
              junior developers. Cox (2018) told me that “taking on junior developers is risky. It can affect
              the employers who hire junior developers because they have to put a lot of time and money into
              training them up. If they spend a long time training them up and they don’t work out, then
              that’s the junior developer’s time wasted and, the company’s time and money wasted too”.
              <br />
              <br />
              After listening to what Ian had to say, I took to twitter recently to see what people in the
              industry made of this. After just typing in “hire junior developers” into Twitters search bar,
              I found multiple tweets from experienced developers who express to their followers that hiring
              junior developers is not the end of the world AND will actually help the industry grow. One tweet
              I read that caught my attention is one from @StevieBuckley, who comments on how companies he has
              worked for in the past believe that they don’t have time to train junior developers. Buckley
              (Buckley, 2018) quotes “Our team are too busy to mentor junior developers”. In addition, Buckley
              states, “This short-termism is a weak and costly excuse”. This is not to say that having junior
              developers is better than having senior developers however, it is saying that having junior developers
              is beneficial for both any company and junior developers in the industry.
