        <h3 class="sub-titles">Aim:</h3>
        <p class="blog-content">
          The aim of this project is to broaden my knowledge (the little amount of it) on the
          CSS extention, Sass. I aim to learn and use Sass code correctly and in an efficient
          manor by using a Sass compiler, such as Koala, to convert my Sass code into CSS.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3 class="sub-titles">Objectives</h3>
        <p class="blog-content">
          My main objectives are:
          <ul>
            <li>To learn about Sass and why using it is a suitable substitute for CSS</li>
            <li>To learn about Sass compilers and why they are a useful tool to use alongside Sass</li>
            <li>To use Sass in my code to make my code more efficient</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3 class="sub-titles">Definition:</h3>
        <p class="blog-content">
          I will use the CSS extension Sass to learn the code to see if using Sass to develop the design
          of my website. To do this I will be looking at Sass’ nesting features, functions, and media query
          includes. As well as applying variables for fonts and colours that may be used many times throughout
          my code.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
          To help me compile my Sass code (and all other code) I will be using a compiler application: Koala.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3 class="sub-titles">Set Up:</h3>
        <p class="blog-content">
          Before I could start coding in Sass, I needed to install it to my computer by using Cmder.
          A command line emulator which I would use to install the latest version of Sass as a Node.js
          package by entering <strong><code>npm install –g sass</code></strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
          Once Sass was installed and the Sass file was
          created in my project folder, I had to add the Sass file to my compiler, Koala.
        </p>

            Adding the folder to Koala so that it can automatically compile the sass file into CSS
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="blog-content">
          Koala’s user interface shows that the main.scss is highlighted green, as this is the file
          that is being compiled. The main.css file is greyed out as this is the file where all the
          Sass code will be outputted.
        </p>

        <div class="image-holder">
          <img src="../sass-images/koala-success.jpg" alt="">
          <p class="image-description">
            This alert informs us that the save and compile of the Sass file was a success.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="sub-titles">How:</h3>
        <p class="blog-content">
          To demonstrate how I learned and used Sass, I decided to create a basic landing page with some
          minimal content as to focus more on coding the Sass.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
          One of the great things about using Sass is the ability to use variables.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
          <i>
            “Think of variables as a way to store information that you want to reuse
            throughout your stylesheet. You can store things like colors, font stacks,
            or any CSS value you think you'll want to reuse.”
          </i>
          (Sass-lang.com, n.d)
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
          Variables allow you to define a value for a property, such as the main body font size, and call
          upon it multiple times within the code. The useful thing about Sass variables is, if the size
          of the font needs to change and the code has been written many times, just by changing the value
          of the variable, will update the new value for wherever the variable is called in the code.

          Media queries are a vital in modern web development. Allowing a website to accommodate all device
          sizes from desktop to mobile is a curtail part of making a website accessible.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
          <i>
            “Media queries let you adapt your site or app depending on the presence or value of various
            device characteristics and parameters… they are a key component of responsive design.”

        <p class="blog-content">
          Sass reduces the tedious code writing that comes with writing media queries. To implement media
          queries you can define the minimum width, like you normally would e.g. <strong><code>min-width: 840px;</code></strong>, as a
          variable which you then feed into <strong><code>mixin</code></strong> function.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-content">
          By using this <strong><code>mixin</code></strong> function, you can add an <strong><code>include</code></strong> to the section of the site that would need
          editing on a smaller screen (or larger when doing a mobile first approach). Turning this:

          <i>
            “Nesting in Sass allows you to write descendant selectors in a syntax that is more natural
            and easier to read.”
          </i>
          (Belman, 2016)
        </p>

        <p class="blog-content">
          Nesting is a very useful feature that Sass has over CSS. Nesting is a clean way of writing code
          were the parent and child properties values need to be defined together. In my code for my demonstrator
          I needed to define properties for the #bg which was in the body html tag. Usually in CSS to write any
          code for this you would write it like this:
        </p>

        <div class="image-holder">
          <img src="../sass-images/nesting-css.jpg" alt="">
        </div>

        <p class="blog-content">
          Sass’ syntax makes this code easier to read and understand as you can clearly see what the #bg is a
          child of this:
        </p>

        <div class="image-holder">
          <img src="../sass-images/nesting-sass.jpg" alt="">
        </div>

        <p class="blog-content">
          Functions are another helpful feature that Sass has and work the same way that functions work in
          other languages, like JavaScript. I used a function to pass through different colour variables I had
          used. This function allowed me to define variables for each colour I was going to use in the
          demonstrator within a parent variable.
        </p>

        <div class="image-holder">
          <img src="../sass-images/colors-variable.jpg" alt="">
          <p class="image-description">
            All the different colour variables within the parent variable.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="image-holder">
          <img src="images/blog-images/sass-images/color-function.jpg" alt="" width="700">
          <p class="image-description">
            The function to run the variables.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="blog-content">
          To then refer to this function and call a specific colour variable, all I had to do to was write
          <strong><code>background-color: color(primary)</code></strong>;
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-titles">Evaluation:</h3>
        <p class="blog-content">
          After using Sass as appose to CSS I can now answer my question that I asked myself; is Sass a
          good substitute for CSS?
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
          And my answer is no. I think Sass is a good partner to CSS. Using Sass to write your code and
          compiling into CSS is a good method to writing code. The readability and features that Sass has
          over CSS is a big benefit. However, being able to automatically compile the Sass code into CSS
          with a compiler, such as Koala, is the way forward with modern front-end development.
