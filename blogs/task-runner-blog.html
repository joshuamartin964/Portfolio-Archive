        <h3 class="sub-titles">Aim:</h3>
        <p class="blog-content">
          The aim of this project is to learn how to help myself deploy my website by
          learning how to use task runners to help with my version control of my site.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3 class="sub-titles">Objectives</h3>
        <p class="blog-content">
          My main objectives are:
          <ul>
            <li>Research what task runners are used for</li>
            <li>Learn about how to correctly use one</li>
            <li>Use a task runner alongside the development and deployment of my site</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3 class="sub-titles">Definition:</h3>
        <p class="blog-content">
          To learn about task runners and why they are useful. I will be looking at Git and Gulp.js to
          see why developers use the tools when they are coding. I will look further into this by using
          one of these task runners alongside the development of my site to help accompany my research.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
          Task runners are as self-explanatory as they come. Task runners run tasks. Gulp, being the task
          runner I decided to use for my demonstrator, can be set up to connect to a project folder, in a
          file called gulpfile.js, to run specific tasks that you might have to do manually. Examples of
          these tasks would be: compiling Sass files; optimising images; minify JavaScript files and many more.
        </p>

            “There are a lot of tasks involved with creating and deploying a front-end application.
            Common tasks include things like watching file changes, concatenating/minifying files”
          </i>
          (Pennell, n.d)
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3 class="sub-titles">Set Up:</h3>
        <p class="blog-content">
          To start using gulp to run any task I desire, it needs to be installed using the command line by
          typing <strong><code>npm install –g gulp</code></strong>. This will install Gulp.js onto your device.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
          When setting up Gulp in the command line, you need to save Gulp as a “Dev Dependency” by writing
          <strong><code>npm install –save-dev gulp</code></strong>. Gulp is only used on the development
          side as it helps to run tasks so, gulp.js is saved as a development dependency. Meaning that
          it is only local and only required during development. (Avery, 2017).
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
          Now that Gulp is set up and installed, it’s now time to start adding files and folders to the
          project directory. To start off with, an initial folder needs to be created. This folder is where
          all the source code will be, all the HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc. files before they are complied. In
          my example, I have called the folder: ‘src’.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
          The next thing to create is a file called ‘gulpfile.js’. As mentioned before, this file is where
          I will put all the tasks that I want gulp to complete during the development process.
        </p>

        <div class="image-holder">
          <img src="../task-runner-images/creating-images.jpg" alt="">
        </div>

        <h3 class="sub-titles">How:</h3>
        <p class="blog-content">
          Time for the fun stuff. The tasks that I asked Gulp to run were to look at all the files, compile
          them, and send them to a folder which I would then upload. However, two of the main tasks I asked
          Gulp to complete involved optimising images and compiling Sass.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-content">
          Some tasks require extra dev dependencies so that Gulp can run the tasks. To run a task which would
          optimise images I had to set up the dependency the same way as I did with Gulp, <strong><code>npm install –save-dev
              gulp-imagemin</code></strong>.
        </p>

        <div class="image-holder">
          <img src="../task-runner-images/install-imagemin.jpg" alt="">
        </div>

        <p class="blog-content">
          Now to set up the task. Back in the gulpfile.js I needed to tell Gulp to run the task as well as
          telling it what to look for, where to look for it, and where to put the optimised image by using
          the Gulp method: .pipe(gulp.dest(‘dist/images’)). When writing this code and running the task for
          the first time, Gulp will automatically create the ‘dist’ folder.
        </p>

        <div class="image-holder">
          <img src="../task-runner-images/gulp-imagemin.jpg" alt="">
        </div>

        <p class="blog-content">
          Once the task was set up and the file is saved, I needed to back over to command line and run the task.
        </p>

        <div class="image-holder">
          <img src="../task-runner-images/run-imagemin.jpg" alt="">
        </div>

        <p class="blog-content">
          Setting up tasks in gulpfile.js all usually adopt the same method of installing extra dependencies and
          setting up the task.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-content">
          So, to have a task that compiles my Sass files, I have to go through the same steps that I had to go
          through for the image optimisation task.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-content">
          So… installing Sass to gulp is: <strong><code>npm install –save-dev gulp-sass</code></strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-content">
          Back into gulpfile.js. A similar syntax of the image optimisation task is used to create the Sass
          compiler task. However, there are a few additional things that need to be added to run this task.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-content">
          To start off, the task needs to be ran as a function. Again, we tell Gulp what to look for, where
          to look for it, and where to distribute the compiled version. But now, a new method is added to
          look for any errors that Sass may create. This is just a cautionary method. added to run this task.
        </p>

        <div class="image-holder">
          <img src="../task-runner-images/gulp-sass.jpg" alt="">
        </div>

        <p class="blog-content">
          Finally, we run the task using the same syntax as <strong><code>imageMin</code></strong>, which
          will be replaced with sass.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-content">
          As of now, every time I want a task to run after a file is saved or an image is added I have to
          manually run all the tasks individually. Gulp allows you to set up a task which can run all the
          tasks at the same time. This is done by setting a new task which takes all the task that have
          already been created, and runs them all in a series. This task can save you from the tedious
          task of running each task individually.
        </p>

        <div class="image-holder">
          <img src="../task-runner-images/gulp-all-tasks.jpg" alt="">
        </div>

        <p class="blog-content">
          So when I run just gulp in the command line, all the tasks run one after another.
        </p>

        <div class="image-holder">
          <img src="../task-runner-images/run-all-tasks.jpg" alt="">
        </div>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p class="blog-content">
          One final task I created told Gulp to run all the tasks at once without me having to run
          them individually.
        </p>

        <div class="image-holder">
          <img src="../task-runner-images/gulp-watch.jpg" alt="">
        </div>

        <p class="blog-content">
          However, now this new task, <strong><code>watch</code></strong>, will watch all the tasks and
          when any changes are made it will automatically run the task without me running gulp every change.
        </p>

        <div class="image-holder">
          <img src="../task-runner-images/run-watch.jpg" alt="">
        </div>

        <h3 class="sub-titles">Evaluation:</h3>
        <p class="blog-content">
          After using the gulp.js task runner to help with my version control, I can now answer my question
          that I asked myself; are task runners as good as they’re hyped up to be?
        </p>

        <p class="blog-content">
          The answer is. Yes! Yes! Yes!
        </p>

        <p class="blog-content">
          Task runners are a great tool to use when developing a project. Being able to create a variety
          of different tasks to complete a variety of things automatically, that you would normally have to
          manually do is a great feeling. And will save you more time than you think.
        </p>

            “You can specify which tasks you want a task runner to perform and it will do all the work
            for you… each time that you make a change, you would have needed to complete each task
            separately. That would get annoying really quick. Not to mention you would waste an egregious
            amount of time repeating yourself. Not fun”
